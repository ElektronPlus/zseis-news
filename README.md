Scrape news from [school site (https://zseis.zgora.pl/)](https://zseis.zgora.pl/) and send them throught Discord!

This doesn't require own hosting as it uses [:octocat: GitHub Actions](https://github.com/konhi/zseis-news/actions).

# üìê Technical info
- You can't get id of entry in easy way (to my knowledge other than brute-forcing), so script generates a checksum (`md5(title + dateModified)) to check what news were already sent to Discord
- Script has hard-coded that there are 4 news per page and will throw error if will find more, this is due to not well structured HTML of website. This also leads to news extracter seem to be a bit unintuitive.
- It uses Discord Webhooks and requires function in other bot to crosspost on announcement channel.

# üî® Developing
```
git clone https://github.com/konhi/zseis-news.git
cd zseis-news
echo WEBHOOK_URL="<https://discord.com/api/webhooks/xxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" > .env
npm install
```

- `npm run start`: builds and runs the script
- `npm run test`: code testing using jest
- `npm run lint`: automatically fix problems and show style errors
- `npm run dev`: TypeScript compiler watch for changes
- `node dist/main.js`: run main program (without compiling)
